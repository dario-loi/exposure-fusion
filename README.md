<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Sample Image][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

The project was created as classwork for the course *Computer Graphics* at Sapienza University
of Rome, it is licensed under the MIT license and is free to use for any purpose.

It improves on the Stanford paper [Exposure Fusion](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs231m/project-1/exposure-fusion.pdf), by adding an alignment pipeline that can improve outputs when the input sequence's photos are offset from eachother.

The repository contains both a class `exposure_fusion.py` and a TKinter GUI `gui.py` that 
can use the class in a user friendly way`.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To use the class it is enough to copy the `exposure_fusion.py` file into your project and import it.

```python

from exposure_fusion import ExposureFusion

fuser = ExposureFusion()

```

### Prerequisites

The class requires a set of common scientific and computer vision packages, such as:

* `numpy`
* `opencv`

For the rest of the files in the repository, one might also need:

* `tkinter`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

As shown in the <a href="#getting-started">Getting Started</a> section, the class is easy to set up. 
Each method has an associated docstring that goes into its intended purpose and usage, however, one does *not* need to concern himself with the implementation details, since the class implements the `__call__` dunder method, that correctly performs the Exposure Fusion pipeline on the images

Example:

```python

from exposure_fusion import ExposureFusion

fuser = ExposureFusion(perform_alignment = False)

# Load images

images = [cv2.imread(path) for path in image_paths]

HDR = fuser(images)

```

The fusion pipeline's parameters are set by the class's `__init__` method, and can be changed by the user. The default parameters are what gave us the best result during our tests.
